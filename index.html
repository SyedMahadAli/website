 <h2> 1. Eat a variety of foods: </h2>
 <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp For good health, we need more than 40 different nutrients, and no single food can supply them all. It is not about a single meal,
<br> it is about a balanced food choice over time that will make a difference!

A high-fat lunch could be followed by a low-fat dinner.
After a large meat portion at dinner,
<br> perhaps fish should be the next dayâ€™s choice.
</p>
<h2> 2. Base your diet on plenty of foods rich in carbohydrates:  </h2>
<p> 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp About half the calories in our diet should come from foods rich in carbohydrates,
 such as cereals, rice, pasta, potatoes, and bread. It is a good idea to include at
<br> least one of these at every meal. Wholegrain foods, like wholegrain bread, pasta, and cereals, will increase our fibre intake.


</p>


<h2>3. Enjoy plenty of fruits and vegetables:      </h2>
<p>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Fruits and vegetables are among the most important foods for giving us enough vitamins, minerals and fibre. We should try to eat at least 5 servings a day.
<br> For example,
 a glass of fresh fruit juice at breakfast, perhaps an apple and a piece of watermelon as snacks, and a good portion of different vegetables at each meal.
